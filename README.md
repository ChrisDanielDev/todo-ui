To run the example please the following command

Install dependencies
--
```
npm i
```

Run react in dev mode as a server
--
```
npm start
```

Make sure that the backend is started, check the README file in the backend file


Consideration
----

In a production env the frontend project can be build in the docker file.
The backend server can serve the static files generated by frontend using multi stage build and serving them using express
